// Varibles in programming:

var myVarible = 10
myVarible = 2
myVarible = myVarible + 3

// first myVarible = 10
// then myVarible = 2
// then varible = 5





// Constants in programming:

const myConstant = 10
const newConst = myConstant - 2

// myConstant = 10 and cannot be changed
// newConst = 8 and cannot be changed
